The user is prompted to enter a number.

The program reads the number and checks:

    If it is zero, it increments the zero_count.
    
    If it is negative, it adds the number to minus_sum.
    
    If it is positive, it adds the number to plus_sum.
    
Finally, it prints the count of zeros, the sum of negative numbers, and the sum of positive numbers.
